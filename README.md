#### :mega: Just a note
I created this sofware for an assingment in my CyberSecurity class. Our job was to create our own malware. I highly discourage using this against someone else. I am responsible for creating it, but not responsible for its use against another user.

#### :coffee: Installation & Usage
1. Download or Clone the files from the repo.
2. Make sure you have Python 3+ on your machine
3. Open the destination folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the needed packages.
4. Open `main.py` and adjust config values as needed.
5. [ OPTIONAL ] Run `auto-py-to-exe` to compile this program into an EXE.
6. [ TIP ] If you want to compile Token Monster into an EXE, ZIP it to download it on Chrome.

#### :rocket: Where to go from here?
From experience, I know a few "wise guys" will choose to use this software for nefarious purposes. So for my next project, Ill consider making a tool that **protects** your Discord token from all of the token grabbers that are out there.
